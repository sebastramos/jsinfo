// You have an array of user objects, each one has name, surname and id.

// Write the code to create another array from it, of objects with id and fullName, where fullName is generated from name and surname.

let john = { name: "John", surname: "Smith", id: 1 };
let pete = { name: "Pete", surname: "Hunt", id: 2 };
let mary = { name: "Mary", surname: "Key", id: 3 };

let users = [ john, pete, mary ];

  let usersMapped = users.map(element => ({
  fullName: `${element.name} ${element.surname}`,
  id: element.id
  }))

/*
usersMapped = [
  { fullName: "John Smith", id: 1 },
  { fullName: "Pete Hunt", id: 2 },
  { fullName: "Mary Key", id: 3 }
]
*/

console.log( usersMapped[0].id ) // 1
console.log( usersMapped[0].fullName ) // John Smith
// So, actually you need to map one array of objects to another. Try using => here. Thereâ€™s a small catch.
